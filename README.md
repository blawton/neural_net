# neural_net

Two different implementations of a neural net intended for classifying CIFAR-10 image data. One (3.1) has a single convolution layer and is coded from scratch, while the other (3.2) has multiple layers of convolution and is implemented using the tensorflow library.

CIFAR data needed to run the program can be found at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html (the program uses the CIFAR-10 data)
